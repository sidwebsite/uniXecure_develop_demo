                                        <h3 class="mb-3 text-primary">Agglomerating information security ecosystem with MOC services</h3>
                                        <p>SYSTEX has decades of experience in information security services; its MOC (Monitoring and Operation Center) information security operation and maintenance service are highly acclaimed. It provides one-stop information security services from prevention before incidents, detection during incidents and action after incidents, fully preventing potential threats.</p>
                                        <p>Facing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, enterprises hastened the implementation of digital transformation, and are actively marching towards smart manufacturing, smart finance, smart operations, smart retailing and smart services, etc., expecting to strengthen their competitiveness in future markets. Hackers have also expanded their attack frequencies and ranges as enterprises are trying to connect their IT and OT systems, resulting in a significant increase in global information security incidents in the past two years; many enterprises in Taiwan have also fallen victim. As Taiwan’s largest information service enterprise, SYSTEX became the first choice of many enterprises to help them restore their information systems and business processes after the outbreak of information security threat incidents. To further provide Taiwan enterprises with more complete services, SYSTEX officially established uniXecure Corporation to assist enterprises with the increasingly severe information security threats, and to protect their important digital data and business reputations.</p>
                                        <p>The Vice President of SYSTEX, Jackie Chan, stated that looking back at the beginning of 1997, SYSTEX already discovered that information security issues were already gradually on the rise, and would become inevitable challenges for enterprises in the future. Therefore, they started investing in agency and distribution of products from large international information security companies, and formed alliance ecosystems with startup information security partners in Taiwan to propose industrial solutions to meet the need of information security protection from the various information security difficulties faced by industries when applying new technologies. Now, we have become the first choice partner when many international information security brands are entering the Taiwan market, and through the cooperation with international information security companies, the information security team of SYSTEX can further grasp the latest information security trends and technical capabilities. As a matter of fact, SYSTEX had already launched the MOC (Monitoring and Operation Center) many years ago, and is praised by many industrial customers. This time, it has established uniXecure Corporation hoping to provide customers with more comprehensive services, and to act as a strong shield to defend against hacker intrusions.</p>
                                        <h3 class="mb-3 text-primary">One-stop information security service – assisting enterprises to respond to threats automatically</h3>
                                        <p>Although there are many types of information security devices available on the market, when facing the constantly evolving malware, ransomware and viruses, only through collaboration and cooperation with different information security device and service companies can they be blocked and intercepted effectively.</p>
                                        <p>And SYSTEX, which has decades of experience in the information security field, discovered that enterprises nowadays are incapable of establishing information security joint defense mechanisms due to the lack of information security talents; therefore, they must rely on the help of experienced and professional outsourced information security teams. Therefore, the original intention of establishing uniXecure Corporation was hoping to have professional information security teams establish information asset protection mechanisms to allow government agencies and enterprises to enjoy one-stop information security services from prevention before incidents, detection during incidents and action after incidents using subscriptions, meeting the needs of enterprise operation and the implementation of information security.</p>
                                        <p>Jackie Chan stated that most of the SOC (Security Operation Center) mechanisms of information security service companies on the market can only detect malware after intrusions, which means that they can only carry out mitigation work after incidents occur; they cannot further achieve prevention and monitoring in advance. We are different from other information security service companies from before incidents, during incidents and after incidents aspects; not only can we assist with the management of information security devices of enterprises and provide 24/7 monitoring services, but we also rely on information security monitoring and threat intelligence response management platforms in order to exert the purpose of information security joint defense.</p>
                                        <p>The General Manager of uniXecure Corporation, Foster Wu, stated that for the APT attacks and zero-day vulnerability attack methods in recent years, the MOC of uniXecure Corporation can quickly detect them, and it integrates the exception notification information from various monitoring systems at the endpoints, and compares them with the databases of each monitoring system to determine the information security incident level and handling; it can provide customers with exception incident warnings and recommend solutions instantly. According to our actual experience in assisting customers handling incidents, MOC can detect and solve the problems through automated mechanisms within several hours or even several minutes, blocking malware intrusions first-hand and achieving the purpose of reducing business damage.</p>
                                        <h3 class="mb-3 text-primary">Assisting enterprise meet compliances Effectively implementing information security systems</h3>
                                        <p>Given that Taiwan has already become a target for hacker attacks, in order to improve the overall information security protection and information security awareness of enterprises, the Financial Supervisory Commission amended the “Regulations Governing Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies” at the end of 2021, requiring listed companies to have chief information security officers and establish dedicated information security units.</p>
                                        <p>The pushing of this policy by the Financial Supervisory Commission is equivalent to raising the level of information security issues, and the establishment of dedicated units is to hope that enterprises have a high degree of information security awareness and vigilance. Jackie Chan explained: “With the shortage of information security talents around the world, having professional outsourced companies to provide assistance is the best practice, and naturally, uniXecure Corporation is the best choice.”</p>
                                        <p>uniXecure Corporation was formed by the senior information security team of SYSTEX; it has rich construction experience for almost a hundred companies across various industrial fields. Secondly, the MOC of uniXecure Corporation has already obtained ISO 20000, ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 international certifications; it has high-quality information security service capabilities. It also meets the confidentiality, integrity and availability expectations of public service agencies and enterprise operations.</p>

                                        <p>In light that the manufacturing industry is in the process of taking big steps marching towards smart manufacturing, their originally closed OT and IT environments must be connected; therefore, they will definitely face unprecedented information security challenges. For this reason, whether users should pay additionally for information security or whether equipment suppliers should include information security in the function items of their equipment needs to be explored. In this regard, uniXecure Corporation not only plans information security solutions for enterprises individually, but it also cooperates with tool machine manufacturers to include information security solutions in their machine designs to ensure the security of IoT environments, and provide complete solutions for end customers to receive information security protection.</p>
                                        <p>Foster Wu further indicated that manufacturers are all trying to introduce smart manufacturing, smart scheduling smart war situation and other solutions through the hybrid cloud architecture. For this, uniXecure Corporation also provides information security solutions with hybrid cloud environments. For example, a large golf course company in the southern Taiwan used an information security monitoring platform to help collect the records of all ground and cloud information systems and grasp resource usage situations, protecting the information security line of defense for cloud and ground in one-stop.</p>
                                        <p>Jackie Chan stated: We hope to use our long-term alliance experience with leading international information security companies to form alliances with startup information security teams in Taiwan through the connected system integration service capacities between uniXecure Corporation and the SYSTEX Group. In addition to providing exclusive solutions for different industry users by creating information security ecosystems, we also wish to enter the international market with teams to allow Taiwan’s information security technology service energy to shine in the world.</p>
